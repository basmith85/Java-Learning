# Java Learning Repository

This repository is a structured archive of my hands-on Java learning and practice. It includes beginner exercises, mini projects, and topic specific examples that reinforce core Java programming concepts.

## Structure

### `JavaPractice/`
Contains topic based practice files aligned with a full-length Java tutorial. Each file is named with a number and title to indicate the topic it covers (e.g., `_01_Intro`, `_02_Variables`, etc.). These files demonstrate foundational syntax, logic, and best practices.

### `JavaProjects/`
A collection of mini projects that apply Java concepts in more realistic or interactive ways.

### `NOTES.md`
A cumulative Markdown file containing detailed written notes on each Java topic as I progress. It includes concepts, syntax explanations, and practical usageâ€”designed as a personal reference guide and review sheet.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A personal learning log
- A reference for reviewing Java syntax and logic
- A portfolio of practice code and projects
- A resource for others starting out with Java
